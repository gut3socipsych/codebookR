# codebookR

##Problem 

Creating factor variable details (i.e., levels and label) manually in R may be time consuming and produce several lines of code.  

The details of research variables should be well documented in a format easily shared with others.  



##Solution 

R Function (codebookR) that reads Excel format codebooks and creates factor variables.  


##Details 

Basic function to read a single Excel containing coding information has been developed -- more to come.
